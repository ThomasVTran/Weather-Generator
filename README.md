# Weather-Generator
Using my limited knowledge of JavaScript and my limited usage of server-side API's I challenged myself to create a forecast generator as to put myself into the shoes of more experienced developers. During the process of this development I have learned better/ more efficient methods in order to get data from URL requests and append/divide them into their appropriate elements. In the future this project will serve many strides in my developer career.
